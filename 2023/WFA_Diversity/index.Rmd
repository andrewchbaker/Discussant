# .center.pull[Research Question]

<br>

**Do firms truthfully disclose their commitments to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in their financial statements?**

- Are there market implications for talking more about diversity than is reflected in underlying actions?

- We focus on diversity in this paper given:

  - Prior literature.
  - Recent investor attention and public commentary.
  - Data availability.
  
---

# .center.pull[Motivation: Diversity "Policies" and "Targets"]

- Disconnect between share of firms with policies and those with actual concrete targets.
  - What do we draw from this?

                        dpi = 500)
```

# .center.pull[Motivation: Legal and Regulatory Action]

- SEC very interested in standardizing ESG disclosures.

- Around 40 lawsuits filed since 2020 related to diversity washing.

- Many of these suits have centered on public commitments in financial documents.


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here::here("2023/WFA_Diversity/figures", "diversity_headlines.png"),

```

# .center.pull[Diversity Washing]

- **DEI disclosures are relatively new.**

  - Little to no regulation or standardization.
  - Impossible or costly verification.
  
    - **Potential benefits to diversity washing:**
    
      - Enhanced reputation among stakeholders.
      
      - Capital flow with rise of ESG investing.
      
    - **Potential Costs:**
    
      - Litigation (has historically been very rare).
      
      - Diversity audits (only 8 proposals passed in 2022.)

# .center.pull[Our Contribution]

<br>
** We construct measures of underlying firm-level diversity, which we can compare with discussion of diversity in financial disclosures.**

- **Advantages of our approach**:

  - Allows us to peak "under the hood" at a non-self-disclosed measure of actual diversity.
  - Breadth: we can measure diversity along cross-section and time-series.
  
- **Real-world relevance**:

  - Firms have been accused of diversity washing, but evidence so far consists of anecdotes.
  - Can provide evidence on the implications of diversity washing for firms and fund flow.

# .center.pull[Data]

<br>

- Sample: **All Firms in Compustat-CRSP File** from **2008 to 2021**.

- Variety of data sources:

  - **Revelio Labs**: Firm-year level diversity measures.
  
  - **EDGAR Filings (WRDS SEC Analytics Suits):** Raw text of 10Ks, DEF 14As, 8Ks.
  
  - Additional Data Sources: Compustat, CRSP (securities prices and mutual fund holdings), Sustainalytics, Thompson Reuters (13-F holdings and Refinitiv), Goodjobsfirst, Twitter, Corporate Register.

# .center.pull[Revelio Labs: Diversity Data]

- Aggregates measures of firm diversity at firm-year level.

    - Compiles data from hundreds of millions of online public profiles and resumes.
    
    - Prediction-based algorithm to assign gender and race/ethnicity from name and location.
    
        - Trained on Census and voter registration data. 
        
- Caveats:

  - Data is imperfect. But
      - Firm has done analyses to validate its accuracy. 
      - Sample may be biased towards professionals. 
      
  - 90% correlation for females when compared to sample of disclosing firms (Liang et al. 2022, WP)

# .center.pull[DEI Related Disclosures]

- Difficult to observe all possible disclosure channels.

- Focus on EDGAR documents:

  - **Coverage:** All publicly traded firms have to file.
  
  - **Increasingly essential avenue** for firm communication about ESG-related activities and commitments.
  
  - **Firms have recently come under scrutiny for false or misleading commitments** to diversity in their financial disclosures.
  
  - **SEC currently has proposals for ESG disclosures under review**.
  
  - **Representative** of external stance on DEI.
  
---

# .center.pull[Dictionary Based Approach]

- Build upon dictionary-based approaches commonly used in finance.

- **Steps:**

  - Assemble a dictionary of key DEI-related words from online DEI dictionaries.
      - e.g. "Equal Pay", "Affirmative Action", "Sexual Orientation"
      
  - Remove terms that have alternative meanings in financial documents (e.g., equity)
      - replace with bigrams where possible (e.g. "pay equity")
      
  - Count DEI terms across SEC filings.
  
- **Summary:** Measure the extent of DEI discussions in financial statements. 

---

# .center.pull[How Do Firms Talk about DEI (in progress)]

<br>

- Extract the sentences with DEI words.

- Use `word2vec` and `kmeans` to identify topics.

- Have RAs label topics and classify them into categories:

    - Community engagement, governance, employee characteristics, legal concerns, etc.
    
- Measure the tone of the sentences with DEI words and correlate it with our washing measure.

# .center.pull[DEI Disclosures and Diversity]
    
- We document a **positive but weak** relationship in aggregate between DEI disclosures and underlying diversity.
    - Consistent with prior work.
    - Results slightly stronger without FEs, but remain economically very small 
    - Incremental $R^2$ only on order of 0.1-0.7%.

# .center.pull[Empirical Measure of Diversity Washing]
<br> 
<div align="center">
 1) **Diversity Washing Level** = $\eta_{DEI}$ - $\eta_{Diversity}$
 
 2) **Diversity Washers** = $\mathbb{1}(\eta_{DEI} > \eta_{Diversity})$
 
<div align="left">

<br> 
- Disparity between DEI word count and underlying diversity.

    - Assumption being that these measures should be correlated.
    
- Similar rationale to prior studies using **abnormal textual measures** (e.g. Teoh et al. 2014, Bushee et al. 2017)

# .center.pull[Diversity Washing and ESG Ratings]

- ESG rating agencies rely heavily on firm disclosures.

    - "... a default value of 0 is assigned... when no relevant data is found in the public disclosure of companies." - Refinitiv Methodology guide.
    
- Diversity washers have *2-13% higher ESG ratings* than other firms. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = '80%'}

---
# .center.pull[Diversity Washing and ESG Ownership]

- Firms might use opportunistic DEI disclosures to attract investors.

    - Socially-responsible capital could be misallocated as a result.
    
    - The SEC is very concerned with this question.
    
- Diversity washers have approximately *10% Higher ESG fund ownership* than could be expected. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = '65%'}

# .center.pull[Diversity Washing as an Aspiration]

- Could DEI disclsoure channel signal aspiration to become more diverse?

  - **No evidence of future increases in diversity hiring**.
  - **Similar results focusing on senior employees**.

# .center.pull[Conclusion]

<br> 

- We provide large-sample evidence consistent with:

    - Weak correlation between discussion of DEI and actual underlying diversity.
    
    - Aggregate correlation masks large underlying disparity between disclosed commitments to DEI and hiring practices.
    
    - This disparity is correlated with ESG ratings and fund flows, similar to worries about misallocated capital with unverifiable disclosures.
